fix(renderer): fix character clipping and emoji line cropping

- add _get_char_render_width() to use actual render width instead of advance width
- replace all font.getlength() calls with new method for accurate character width
- adjust line height calculation to include emoji size for emoji-containing lines
- add 2px width safety margin for all wrap judgments
- apply 2px bold compensation for bold characters to avoid clipping during offset rendering

fixes character right-edge clipping (e.g., "MoviePilot") and emoji line vertical cropping
